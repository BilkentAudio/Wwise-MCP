## Tool List

Below is the list of commands exposed by Wwise-MCP, along with example prompts you can give to your MCP client (i.e Claude).

---

### `connect_to_wwise`

**Description**  
Reconnects Wwise-MCP to the currently active Wwise Authoring session.

**Example prompts**

- “Connect to my Wwise project.”
- “Reconnect to the current Wwise session.”
- “Make sure you’re connected to Wwise before doing anything else.”

---

### `resolve_all_path_relationships_in_parent`

**Description**  
Builds a path-first index of all objects under a given parent path (subtree). This lets Claude “see” and navigate the structure of your Wwise project via paths.

**Example prompts**

- “Resolve all path relationships in `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy`.”
- “Index everything under `\Events` so you can browse my events.”
- “Resolve all path relationships in `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit`.”

---

### `create_objects`

**Description**  
Creates one or more Wwise objects (Actor-Mixers, Buses, Containers, Sounds, Work Units, etc.) given their names, types, and parent paths. If no parent paths are provided, the command can re-use `prev_response_objects` from the last call. 

**Note**: this does not create events as there are more considerations to account for during event creation. Event creation is handled by the `create_events` function (below). 

**Example prompts**

- “Create three child objects called `AM_Footsteps`, `AM_Weapons`, and `AM_Ambience` as ActorMixers under `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit`.”
- “Using the objects returned from the previous call, create a `RandomSequenceContainer` named `UI_Clicks_Random` under each of them.”
- “Create a new bus called `SFX_Master` under `\Master-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit`.”

---

### `create_blend_tracks`

**Description**  
Creates one or more Blend Tracks inside existing Wwise Blend Containers. If no Blend Container paths are provided, the command can re-use `prev_response_objects` from the last call.

**Note**: this only creates the Blend Track objects themselves. It does not assign a crossfade RTPC or Game Parameter. Those relationships must be configured separately.

**Example prompts**

- “Create two Blend Tracks called `Near` and `Far` inside `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Vehicles\Engine_BlendContainer`.”
- “Using the Blend Containers returned from the previous call, create Blend Tracks named `Idle`, `Cruise`, and `MaxRPM` in each of them.”
- “Create a Blend Track called `Interior` and another called `Exterior` inside `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Ambience\Room_BlendContainer`.”

---

### `create_events`

**Description**  
Creates multiple Wwise Events in one batch from lists of source objects, destination parent paths, event types, and event names.

**Example prompts**

- “Create a `Play` event called `Play_Footsteps_Grass` for `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Characters\Player\Footsteps_Grass` under `\Events\Default Work Unit\Footsteps`.”
- “Create four `Play` events for these sources: [list paths], and put all of them under `\Events\Default Work Unit\Weapons`.”
- “Batch-create ‘Play’ events for all the sounds you just listed and place them under `\Events\Default Work Unit\Imported`.”

---

### `create_game_objects`

**Description**  
Creates multiple game objects at once in the Wwise sound engine, optionally with initial 3D positions. 

**Note**: Ensure **Start Capture** is toggled before using this command.

**Example prompts**

- “Create five game objects named `RainEmitter_01` through `RainEmitter_05` around the origin at random positions within a radius of 10 units.”
- “Create a game object called `Player` at position (0, 0, 0) and another called `Campfire` at (10, 0, 2).”
- “Create three game objects for birds, spaced evenly along the X-axis from -5 to 5 at Y=0, Z=2.”

---

### `create_rtpcs`

**Description**  
Creates RTPCs in one batch under `\Game Parameters`. You can specify names, parent paths, and min/max ranges. If min/max aren’t specified, assume `0.0` to `100.0`.

**Example prompts**

- “Create RTPCs `Player_Health`, `Player_Stamina`, and `Environment_Density` under `\Game Parameters\Gameplay` with a range of 0 to 100.”
- “Create an RTPC named `Music_Intensity` under `\Game Parameters\Music` from 0.0 to 1.0.”
- “Batch-create RTPCs for `WindSpeed` and `RainIntensity` under `\Game Parameters\Weather` with default ranges.”

---

### `create_switch_groups`

**Description**  
Creates switch groups under `\Switches`. The group must exist before creating its switches.

**Example prompts**

- “Create a switch group `Footstep_Surface` under `\Switches\Default Work Unit`.”
- “Create switch groups `Weather_Type` and `TimeOfDay` under `\Switches\Environment`.”
- “Set up a switch group called `Weapon_Type` under `\Switches\Gameplay`.”

---

### `create_switches`

**Description**  
Creates switches under an existing switch group (whose path should start with `\Switches`).

**Example prompts**

- “Under `\Switches\Default Work Unit\Footstep_Surface`, create switches `Grass`, `Dirt`, `Stone`, and `Metal`.”
- “Add switches `Rain`, `Snow`, and `Wind` to the `Weather_Type` switch group.”
- “Create switches `Day`, `Night`, and `Dusk` under the `TimeOfDay` switch group.”

---

### `create_state_groups`

**Description**  
Creates state groups under `\States`. The group must exist before its child states.

**Example prompts**

**Example prompts**

- “Rename `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit\AM_Temp` to `AM_Environment`.”
- “For the objects you just created, append `_Test` to each of their names.”
- “Rename these paths [list] to [new names] accordingly.”

---

### `get_objects_info`

**Description**  
Retrieves detailed information about one or more Wwise objects by path. You can request standard WAAPI fields (such as `id`, `name`, `type`, `path`, `parent`, `children`, and `notes`) as well as custom properties and references using Wwise's `@` and `@@` syntax.

- `@PropertyName` returns the value authored directly on the object.
- `@@PropertyName` returns the fully resolved value after inheritance and override resolution.

For example, if a Random Container inherits its Output Bus from a parent Actor-Mixer, `@OutputBus` may be empty while `@@OutputBus` returns the inherited bus.

**Example prompts**

- “Get the name, type, path, and notes for `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Weapons\Rifle_Fire`.”
- “Show me `@Volume`, `@Pitch`, and `@@OutputBus` for `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Characters\Player\Footsteps`.”

---

### `get_property_and_reference_names`

**Description**  
Retrieves all valid WAAPI properties and references available for a Wwise object. This is useful when determining which `@Property` and `@@Property` fields can be queried or modified for a specific object type.

**Example prompts**

- “Show me all available properties and references for `\Actor-Mixer Hierarchy\Weapons\Rifle_Fire`.”
- “What fields can I query on this Blend Container?”
- “List every property available on `\Master-Mixer Hierarchy\Default Work Unit\SFX`.”

---

### `get_music_transitions`

**Description**  
Retrieves all Music Transition rules authored inside a Music Switch Container, Music Playlist Container, Music Segment, or other music object. This is useful for inspecting transition logic, synchronization settings, fade behavior, transition segments, source/destination contexts, and cue-based navigation.

**Example prompts**

---

### `post_event`

**Description**  
Posts a Wwise event by name on a specified game object after an optional delay (milliseconds).  
If no game object is given, it posts to the global `Global` game object. If the game object doesn’t exist, it is created automatically.

**Arguments**

- `event_name: str` — Wwise event name to post.
- `game_obj_name: str` — Target game object name (use `"Global"` for 2D / ambience events).
- `delay_ms: int` — Delay before the soundengine posts the event. `0` means post immediately.
- `wait: bool = False` — Reply mode. `False` (default) fire-and-forget: returns as soon as the dispatcher enqueues the call. `True` synchronous: blocks on the WAAPI reply queue, which is useful for serializing a batch of posts. When combined with `delay_ms > 0`, the reply timeout is auto-extended to cover the scheduled future dispatch, so delayed synchronous posts do not spuriously time out.

**Example prompts**

- “Post the `Play_Ambience_Forest` event on the `Global` game object immediately.”
- “Post `Play_Footsteps_Grass` on the `Player` game object with a delay of 500 ms.”
- “Trigger `Stop_All_Music` on `Global` right now.”
- “Post `Play_Stinger` on `Global` and wait for the WAAPI reply before issuing the next event (`wait=True`).”

---

### `set_rtpc`

**Description**  
Sets an RTPC value on a game object over a duration (in ms), from a start value to an end value.  
If no game object is given, applies the RTPC to the `Global` game object.

**Example prompts**

- “Set the RTPC `Music_Intensity` from 0 to 100 over 10 seconds on `Global`.”
- “Ramp `WindSpeed` from 20 to 80 over 5 seconds on the `Player` game object.”

---

### `include_in_soundbank`

**Description**  
Includes specified objects (events, work units, folders, etc.) into one or more soundbanks by path. An optional `filter` selects which inclusion types (`events`, `structures`, `media`) are written; when omitted it defaults to `["events", "structures"]` (the previous fixed behaviour).

**Example prompts**

- “Include `\Events\Default Work Unit\Footsteps` in the soundbank `\SoundBanks\Default Work Unit\Footsteps_SoundBank`.”
